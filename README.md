# About the package
This R package queries information on Air Quality Index of Major cities Sweden of the past 3 months. The user can select which city they want to query. Air Quality Index is given in PMI 10. PM10 is any particulate matter in the air with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less, including smoke, dust, soot, salts, acids, and metals. Particulate matter can also be formed indirectly when gases emitted from motor vehicles and industries undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere. Date and time expressed according to ISO 8601.
